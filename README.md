A Robot's Journey to Life

This repository tracks my journey to become fluent in applied robotics, including:

- Python programming for control and data science
- ROS2 system fundamentals
- Control algorithms (PID, MPC)
- Project design and documentation

 ###🧭 Roadmap
- ✅ Phase 1: Python Fluency (Weeks 1–2)
- ⏳ Phase 2: ROS2 (Weeks 3–4)
- 🔜 Phase 3: Controls (Weeks 5-6)

Each subdirectory includes code, data, and notes.  
Reflections are in `/journal`.

##Python Basics
- matrix_ops: for basic matrix op practice
